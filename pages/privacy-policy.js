            <h2>Information Collection</h2>
            <p>
              At Culili, we collect minimal personal information to facilitate
              the connections between freelance developers and small business
              restaurant owners, and to ensure the smooth operation of our
              platform. The personal information we collect includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>First Name</li>
              <li>Email Address</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Users will also be integrating API keys from other platforms such
              as Stripe and Google Maps with Culili as part of the functionality
              we offer. Additionally, while we will process subscription
              payments, the primary personal information required from our users
              are their first name and email address. Any other personal
              information collected through payment processing is handled
              securely and is not used for other purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the future, we may introduce features that allow users to
              utilize their location to find small restaurants in specified
              areas. This will be a voluntary feature and users will have the
              option to enable or disable location services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information is primarily collected through forms on our platform.
              Additionally, we may collect some metrics and data from
              third-party platforms like Stripe, necessary for enhancing the
              developer dashboard and overall user experience on Culili.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not collect any non-personal information like browser type
